## Should-Haves

These will complete the user experience but are not necessary.

- As a visitor, I want to view an interactive map showing areas with endangered or protected trees so that I can learn more about their locations.

- Given I open the map page, when I zoom or click on markers, then I should see details about specific tree protection zones.
 As a supporter, I want to subscribe to newsletters so that I can stay updated on tree protection campaigns and events.
- Given I enter my email in the subscription box, when I click "Subscribe," then I should receive a confirmation and start receiving updates.

- As a visitor, I want access to educational resources about tree protection laws so that I can understand how to help.
Given I click on the "Laws and Regulations" section, when I browse the page, then I should see a clear list of tree-related laws and their explanations.



## Could-Haves

Would be really cool ... if there's time.

 As a visitor, I want to upload photos and stories of my tree-planting efforts so that I can inspire others to take action.

- Given I navigate to the "Share Your Story" section, when I upload photos and text, then my contributions should appear in a public gallery.
 - As a visitor, I want a chatbot that gives advice on how to protect trees so that I can get quick tips and information.
Given I access the chatbot, when I type a question, then it should provide helpful, relevant answers about tree care and protection.

- As an admin, I want a dashboard to review and moderate user-submitted content so that the website stays accurate and professional.

- Given I log into the admin panel, when I view the submissions section, then I should see user reports and uploaded content for approval.
